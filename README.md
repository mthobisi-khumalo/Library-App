# Library-App
 Develop a web application (Application 1) using Spring MVC and JSP for Library Management. A librarian can login to application and manage books. However, the details of the books and authors are maintained on a separate server (Application 2) which exposes RESTful webservices using Spring Boot to support CRUD operations on books data.
